i)Using key principles of OOP this project was created to effectively manage the stock in a shoe warehouse. Once shoes have been read into the program via a txt file, the program can then:

    Search for a specific shoe using a unique code
    Return the cost of a specific shoe
    Tell you the value of the shoe it's cost and quantity
    Tell you which shoes have the lowest stock and ask if you want to add more
    Tell you which shoes have the highest stock and put this item on sale
    Capture data of new shoes
    View all shoes on database
ii)To install the project run the inventory.py file in the same directory as the inventory.txt file

iii)Below are some screenshots showing you how the program looks when it's running!
